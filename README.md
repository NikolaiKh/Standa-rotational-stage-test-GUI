# Standa-rotational-stage-test-GUI
It is just simple Matlab example how to work with 8SMC5-USB controller and 8MR150 stage. I've used it in larger project in the lab
Standa makes the customers crying, but it works. The full API could be found at https://doc.xisupport.com/en/8smc5-usb/8SMCn-USB/Programming.html
Have fun :)
