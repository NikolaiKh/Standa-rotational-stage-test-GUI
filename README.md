# Standa-rotational-stage-test-GUI
Standa rotational stage test GUI. It is just an example and works with 8SMC5-USB controller and 8MR150 stage.
Standa makes the customers crying, but it works. The full API could be found at https://doc.xisupport.com/en/8smc5-usb/8SMCn-USB/Programming.html
Have fun :)
